# Cattlestrophic_json_creator
Easy-to-use json creator app for cattlestrophic's custom_entity configs 



**Have u ever wondered how to implement cattlestrophic features into your custom animal entity, but you are tired of copy-pasting existing configs or you don't really know the values?**

**Are you a modpack/mod creator and you would like to implement cattlestrophic into your project?**


**This tool is for you, simple, easy-to-use and saves a lot of time!**

### What does it do?
It creates a json file inside a folder. All in the directory where the .exe file is, simple.
To make it work, you need to copy the folder and paste it into cattlestrophic's config directory that supports custom animals

```
C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\[minecraft]\[instance]\config\cattlestrophic_animal_settings
```
**App has been coded in python, no libraries needed, no installation, portable-like version**


This is my own project, no commission, coded for fun just to make your life a little easier.
No further updates, unless cattlestrophic's author is going to change something.
